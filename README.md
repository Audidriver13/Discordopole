Discordopole takes what [Worldopole](https://github.com/brusselopole/Worldopole) left behind and puts it into Discord. The goal is to allow your users to get easy access to useful data.

- Supports **MAD** and **RDM**
- Written with language support in mind. Supports **English**, **German**, **French**, **Spanish** and **Polish**
